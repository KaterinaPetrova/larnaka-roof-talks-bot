# Logging System

This directory contains log files generated by the application. The main log file is `bot.log`.

## Log Format

Logs are formatted as follows:
```
<timestamp> - <module> - <level> - <message>
```

## Exception Logging

All exceptions are logged with detailed context information, including:
- Exception type and message
- Full traceback
- User ID (if available)
- Event ID (if available)
- Additional context information specific to the exception

## Using the Exception Logging System

To log exceptions in your code, use the `log_exception` function from the `utils` package:

```python
from utils import log_exception

try:
    # Your code here
except Exception as e:
    log_exception(
        exception=e,
        context={"key": "value"},  # Additional context as a dictionary
        user_id=user_id,           # User ID if available
        event_id=event_id,         # Event ID if available
        message="Error message"    # Custom message
    )
    # Handle the exception
```

## Automatic Exception Logging

The application automatically logs all unhandled exceptions through the `LoggingMiddleware`. This ensures that even if an exception is not explicitly caught and logged, it will still be recorded with available context information.
